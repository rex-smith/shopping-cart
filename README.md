# Online Storefront Application

This project was created as a part of The Odin Project's ReactJS curriculum. The shopping application
includes a home page, storefront page, and cart page. As users decide on items from the storefront page,
they can go to the dedicated item page where they can add the item in their desired quantity to their cart.
On all pages, they are able to see their cart size in the navbar at the uppermost righthand corner. If the
user clicks on this cart, they can see a dropdown with all of the items in their cart as well as the option
to remove any items they no longer want and the option to proceed to checkout.
